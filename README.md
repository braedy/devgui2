This project intends to exploit user-interface elements to support interaction and creativity.
Sprints were organized within the team to complete various stages of development.

By requirement, the application incorporates serveral GUI aspects: drag and drop, graphics animation, undo/redo, transparency, glass pane, tool tip.

Simplisitic design techniques were adopted. This involved removing unecessary decorations and buttons to create an intuitive playing environment. The player is able to import their own background.

The mouse interaction has been designed to give a fluid experience: large sliders have been employed for custom cuboid creation, placing the user-defined object onto the field of play and setting custom backgrounds can be done without navigating dialogs or menus.
